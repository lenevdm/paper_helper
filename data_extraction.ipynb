For Internet finance and electronic trans-\\nactions, research on fraudulent transaction detection models and\\ntechnologies is a hot spot in the industry [3-5].\\nIn reinforcement learning, the interaction between agent and envi-\\nronment is a Markov Decision Process (MDP). A Markov decision\\nprocess is composed of four tuples (S, A, P, R), that is, state, ac-\\ntion, state transition function, and reward, and the Markov decision\\nprocess should have such properties: The impact of actions taken\\nin a state depends only on that state rather than previous history\\n[6]. Reinforcement learning can regard the classification process\\nas a series of decision-making problems, and transform the data\\ninto several states to carry out the training of the agent. Through\\ntraining, the agent can learn the decision-making strategy, so as\\nto improve the accuracy of model classification. On the anti-fraud\\nissue of Internet finance, reinforcement learning has better coping\\nability for various fraud cases. Using reinforcement learning to\\ncarry out anti-fraud research provides a way to solve the problem\\nof anti-fraud.\\nBased on the Deep Q Learning (DQN) reinforcement learning algo-\\nrithm, this paper studies the detection method of Internet financial\\nfraudulent transactions, designs and implements a fraudulent trans-\\naction detection model, and verifies the model performance on the\\ntransaction data set through experiments.\\n2 LITERATURE REVIEW\\n2.1 Internet Financial Fraudulent Transaction\\nDetection\\nMethods based on rule matching, methods based on account trans-\\naction behavior features, and methods based on inter-account as-\\nsociation are the main researches on Internet financial transaction\\nfraud detection at home and abroad. Among them, the fraud de-\\ntection method based on account transaction behavior features\\nconstructs account transaction behavior features from different\\nangles according to the historical transaction data of accounts, and\\nbuilds a detection model combined with machine learning and deep\\nlearning. The account transaction behavior features can be divided\\ninto: Recency Frequency Monetary (RFM) features based on time\\nwindow, features based on transaction time distribution, features\\nbased on IP address, etc [ 7]. For example, Bashen et al. used the\\nvon Mises distribution to create new features and expanded the\\ntransaction aggregation strategy to evaluate the impact of different\\nfeature sets on fraud detection [8].\\n'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'data/Wang_et_al.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='CSAE 2021, October 19‚Äì21, 2021, Sanya, China Xiaoguo Wang et al.\\nIn recent years, domestic and foreign researches have extensive\\napplications and theoretical support for detection methods based on\\naccount transaction behavior features, including K-nearest neigh-\\nbors (KNN), Bayesian, decision trees, random forest, support vector\\nmachine (SVM), neural network, etc [ 9-11]. On the basis of existing\\nresearch, Luis et al. [ 12] introduced reinforcement learning method\\nto credit card fraud transactions detection, combining reinforce-\\nment learning with supervised learning and unsupervised learning,\\neffectively improving the training speed and accuracy of the de-\\ntection model. In view of the cost of acquiring features in some\\ndetection scenarios, Jaromir et al. [ 13] used Double DQN (DDQN),\\nDueling Architecture and other methods in reinforcement learn-\\ning to build the model, which significantly reduced the number of\\nparameters, and the model had robustness and scalability.\\n2.2 DQN Algorithm\\nThe fraud situation faced by Internet finance is complex, and re-\\ninforcement learning has the ability to adapt to environmental\\nchanges, which can greatly help detect fraudulent transactions.\\nThe core of reinforcement learning is the Markov decision process\\n[6]. The main process is carried out in the interaction between the\\nagent and the environment. For a certain state s‚ààSin the environ-\\nment, the agent needs to take the corresponding action a‚ààA,so\\nthat the environment is transferred to the next state s‚Ä≤according\\nto the state transition function P(s‚Ä≤|s,a), and the reward r(s,a)of\\nenvironmental feedback is received.\\nDQN algorithm [ 14] is a classic algorithm in reinforcement learning.\\nIn traditional reinforcement learning methods such as Q_learning\\nand Sarsa, the state transition function P appears in the form of state\\ntransition table. The algorithm needs to maintain a table to record\\nthe Q value under all combinations of states and actions. However,\\nin some scenarios, the number of states is extremely large or even\\nunpredictable, which makes the algorithm unable to maintain such\\na large table. DQN algorithm uses a value estimation function to\\nreplace the table, introduces the neural network in deep learning,\\nand directly uses the neural network to generate the Q value. In\\nthis paper, the classification is based on DQN, the Q value of the\\nfraud judgment action made by the agent on the transaction data\\nis evaluated, and the better solution is taken as the judgment result\\nto improve the accuracy of fraud detection.\\nThe agent training algorithm of DQN is presented as Algorithm 1 in\\nAppendix. In order to achieve the convergence of the value function,\\nDQN uses experience playback [ 14] to store the state transforma-\\ntion(st,at,rt,st+1)during the learning process. And during the\\nlearning process, the memory transformation data (sj,aj,rj,sj+1)\\nis obtained by batch sampling from the memory bank, and the net-\\nwork parameters are updated with the memory data. DQN adopts\\nœµ-greedy strategy [ 14] in each learning process, in which the agent\\nwill randomly select actions according to a decreasing probability\\nœµ, so that the agent will try more different possibilities in the initial\\nstage of learning.\\n3 RESEARCH METHODOLOGY\\n3.1 Fraudulent Transaction Detection Based\\nDQN\\nFigure 1: Corresponding Features of Each Transaction.\\n3.1.1 Environment Construction and Agent Training. For the trans-\\naction behavior of each account, the payment and receipt trans-\\nactions may represent completely different features. As shown in\\nFigure 1. In order to comprehensively consider the relationship be-\\ntween users‚Äô historical behavior features and transaction accounts,\\nthis paper constructs features based on RFM model. In the RFM\\nmodel, Recency represents the time of the most recent transaction,\\nwhich indicates the time between the user‚Äôs most recent transaction\\nand the present (or as of the statistical period). Frequency is the\\nfrequency of transactions, and consumption frequency refers to\\nthe number of transactions made by users in the statistical period.\\nMonetary is the transaction amount, and the consumption amount\\nrefers to the total amount of transactions made by users during the\\nstatistical period [ 15,16]. And in this paper, the number of trans-\\nfers, the standard deviation of transfer amount, the total amount of\\ntransfers, the number of transfers and the frequency of transfers\\nare calculated for each transaction account. Then we splice the\\npayment and receipt transaction information of the paying and re-\\nceiving account in each transaction and add the amount feature of\\nthe transaction to obtain the transaction data with 21-dimensional\\nfeatures.\\nFor the data obtained by feature construction, we correspond each\\ndata to a state in the environment. As shown in Figure 2. The\\ndata containing the features of RFM model is introduced into the\\nenvironment as a series of states. For each such state, the agent\\nneeds to take corresponding actions, that is, to judge whether each\\ntransaction record is fraudulent or not.\\nIn this paper, Algorithm 1 is used to train the agent. The state con-\\nversion during the learning process is stored. And the memory data\\nis sampled from the memory bank in batches during the learning\\nprocess, and the neural network is updated according to the mem-\\nory data. In the training process, in order to update the parameters\\nin time, if the environment finds that the agent is wrong, the round\\nof training is ended and gradient descent is performed to update\\nthe model parameters, otherwise the agent continues to use the\\nœµ-greedy strategy for action selection.\\n3.1.2 Network Structure. In reinforcement learning, the agent uses\\ndeep learning neural network to calculate the Q value, and selects\\nactions based on the Q value. The network structure uses a fully\\nconnected layer with 25 units as the hidden layer. The network'),\n",

The activation function used in this\\npaper is Relu function. This is because the Relu function greatly\\nreduces the amount of calculation when deriving the derivation\\nduring back propagation and speeds up the training process. And\\nRelu will make the output of some neurons be 0, which causes the\\nsparsity of the network and reduces the interdependence of param-\\neters, thereby alleviating the occurrence of over-fitting problems\\n[17,18]. The Adam algorithm [ 19] is selected as the optimizer to\\nupdate the agent network during the training process, which makes\\nthe model training process more stable.\\n3.1.3 Loss Function. The loss function used in Algorithm 1 is mean\\nsquare error (MSE). However, in the fraud detection problem, for\\nthe case where the distance between some outliers is large, the\\nMSE function may lead to gradient explosion. The SmoothL1 loss\\nfunction solves the unsmooth problem of the L1 loss function, which\\nis more robust and less susceptible to outliers. It can control the\\nmagnitude of the gradient to make the gradient descent more stable.\\nTaking these advantages into account, this article uses the SmoothL1\\nfunction instead of the mean square error function.From the Bayman Equation [ 6], the value estimation function in\\nAlgorithm 1 can be expressed as:\\nQ(s,a)=E[rt+Œ≥Q(st+1,at+1)|st=s,at=a] (1)\\nThen, suppose the target estimated value of the Q function in the\\ntraining process is y:\\ny=r+Œ≥max a‚Ä≤Q\\x00s‚Ä≤,a‚Ä≤;Œ∏‚Ä≤\\x01(2)\\nAnd the overall loss function of this article is as Equation 3):\\nL(Œ∏)=\\x1a\\n0.5(y‚àíQ(s,a;Œ∏))2,i f|y‚àíQ(s,a;Œ∏)|<1\\n|y‚àíQ(s,a;Œ∏)|‚àí0.5,otherwise(3)\\n3.2 Comparison Methods\\nIn order to verify the effectiveness of fraudulent transaction de-\\ntection method based on DQN algorithm on transaction data, this\\npaper selects methods including support vector machine (SVM) [ 20],\\nrandom forest [ 21], KNN (K-Nearest Neighbour) [ 22] and logistic\\nregression [ 23] as a comparative measurement for experimentation.\\n3.3 Data Description\\nThe simulated transaction data set PaySim [ 24] is used in this paper,\\nwhich is widely used for the performance evaluation of fraudulent\\ntransaction detection methods. The data set contains 6,362,620\\ntransaction data. Among all transactions, 8,213 transactions are\\nfraudulent transactions, and the rest are normal transactions. The\\nstep feature in the data set is a time unit. A step corresponds to one\\nhour in reality, ranging from 1 to 743, which corresponds to about\\none month in reality. The amount feature represents the amount of\\neach transaction. The maximum amount in the data set is 92445517,\\nand the minimum is 0. In addition, there are five types of transaction\\ntypes: CASH-IN, CASH-OUT, DEBIT, PAYMENT and TRANSFER.\\nThe fraud transactions included in each transaction type are shown\\nin Table 1. Fraud is the number of fraudulent transactions, and\\nfraudPER represents the proportion of fraudulent transactions in\\nthe total.\\nIn the course of the study, considering that there is no payment in\\nthe merchant account, the merchant account has no classification'),\n",

The fraudulent\\ntransaction detection method based on DQN algorithm is superior\\nto traditional fraudulent transaction detection methods such as\\nsupport vector machine and random forest in Specificity, G-mean,\\nPrecision, F1 Score evaluation metrics, and also has better perfor-\\nmance in OA index. This comes from the advantages of this method\\nat the data level and algorithm level. At the data level, this method\\nconverts the input RFM feature data into states, and learns by way\\nof experience playback after storage, which not only learns the his-\\ntorical transaction features of users, but also breaks the correlation\\nof empirical data. At the algorithm level, the model terminates the\\ntraining once the fraud samples are misclassified, which improves\\nthe model‚Äôs attention to the fraud samples.\\n5 CONCLUSION\\nFor the problem of fraudulent transaction detection in Internet\\nfinance, this paper proposes a fraudulent transaction detection\\nmethod based on the DQN algorithm. This method is based on\\nreinforcement learning. Through the interaction between the agent\\nand the environment, the agent can learn the decision-making strat-\\negy.
